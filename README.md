###A 3D Graphics Engine : How it works ?

Every shape ( like a cube or a pyramid ) is simulated to a set of points.
Some of them are connected and some are not.

Using vector calculations the 3D object is simulated on the screen just like
how it is seen from a point-like eye ( closer objects are bigger ).

By utilizing Rotational matrices you can rotate the object in around any
axis ( x , y or z ). you can also change camera's position and where it is
looking.

you can add any number of points and connect any of them using GUI.

###3D Convex hull : A nice Computational Geometery problem

Finding the smallest ( Area / Volume ) of a convex shape that all points are inside it or
on it's surface.

There are many algorithms for solving 2D version of problem.
