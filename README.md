# 3D_Graphics

## Why this repository exists ?

I am very enthusiastic person when it comes to math and physics, so I wanted to try something new, thus I tried to create
a simple graphics engine using javascript, right now it is a little bit ugly ( but works at least :) ).
Later I decided to add some thing related to computer science too, so I implemented a simple convex hull algorithm.
