# simple_3D_Graphics

This project will simulate a 3D space and an eye ( or you might call it a camera ) spectating it.
you can rotate objects in this space.
all of it is implemented by me using javascript. ( and HTML for basic page design )
solid objects can also be created by introducing a set of points as (x,y,z) to the program and then
connecting eacch two of your choice.
